Dr. John T. Murray is an Assistant Professor of Games and Interactive Media department at the University of Central Florida, USA. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2018. He is co-author of Flash: Building the Interactive Web (MIT Press, 2014) with Anastasia Salter and Adventure Games: Playing the Outsider (Bloomsbury, 2020) with Aaron Reed and Anastasia Salter.

His research focuses on interactive narratives and reality media (augmented, virtual and mixed reality). He investigates both existing and future computational media platforms and authoring tools and has published a number of creative works that explore those same platforms. Salt Immortal Sea is an interactive narrative exploring the experience of a refugee through the lens of ancient legends. It was a collaboration with Mark Marino and Joellyn Rock. Salt Immortal Sea has been translated into French by Mathilde Baudin and is published in the New River Journal and bleuOrange.

Another collaboration with Mark Marino was recently exhibited at the Post Human exhibition as part of the Electronic Literature Organization conference. Murray is currently developing a collaborative cross-platform visual scripting tool, RealityFlow, that aims to improve computational literacy and improve the authoring experience for XR interactive narratives in the tradition of Twine.
